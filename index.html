			<h2>Week One</h2>
			<section>
				<p>Without going too much into the details of my own emotional life as a human, I think it would be a true to say that week one Nashville Software School went pretty well for me overall. The experience of being in an adult learning environment is teaching me a lot about my reactions and responses to life itself and in my own personal experience this type of awareness has allowed me to grow into a better person.
				I'm really glad that it is stresed to not compare myself to others along the path to completing the bootcamp. This has really helped me to relax and enjoy the time at school, and address what I need to focus on in the present moment each day.</p>
				<p>I completed the suggested pre-work leading up to the start. Previously, I had no coding experience, so all of the material was new to me. I think I did a pretty good job of hanging in there and completing the exercises, and came away from it with a decent understanding of how javascript works and feeling prepared to begin the class. HTML seemed much more straight forward to me.<p>
				<p>The people in the cohort all come from different backgrounds and it is refreshing to be around others who have a drive to learn and share what they are learning as well. I've enjoyed getting to know some of the people so far and hope to continue that.</p>
				<p>I completed some of the exercises though not all of them. I made a bank form for a loan application, the beginning of a personal website, and this current blog, as well as made some style sheets for other exercises. I had some trouble with the product card exercise and ended up deleting a large chunk of html work, which in retrospect doesn't really seem appropriate to do. Should probably keep my html work no matter how frustrating the css ends up being.</p>
				<p>I learned about github and how to make branches and work on them locally and then push them up remotely and to create pull requests to merge my work on to the master branch, and then to pull the master down when I want to do more work. I'm really quite amazed that I picked up on that so far.</p>
				<p>In no particular order here are soem other things I've learned about: plugins, communicating with Slack, terminal aliases, linking to css and .js files, pseudoclasses, semantical tags, basic html layouts, making Sublime snippets, MVP, and more fundamentals of for loops.
