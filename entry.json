		"entry": "Week seven started out with a group project. As a group our task was to build a themepark website complete with details about the areas of the park and types of attractions imported from a huge JSON file that was created for the teams to use. We first loaded the data to firebase and the imported it with AJAX calls and pretty much split all the data into separate objects so we could begin to put it on the page the way we wanted. The first day was a lot of planning. I asked a TON of questions to make sure I was on the same page. I had a slight case of imposter sydrome rolling into my group considering I was working with the people in the class who clearly are the quickest programmers in the class, but I managed to hang in there and solidify my role as a genuine team member by the end of the week. I can look at almost every line of code, save for some the post-stretch goals they ended up coding on demo-day, and can tell what is happening. I did end up actually coding some by pulling color theme information from the JSON file and applying it to switch in areas from a dropdown menu. I'm proud of myself for engaging everyday with a committment to learn as best as I could. Having knowledgeable teammates definitely helped in elevating my approach to reading and writing code, the latter being still a struggle. Logic doesn't come easy to me when it comes to thinking about how I want to break things up and use functions and apply them to certain events that happen. I'm done beating myself up about it now though. After seeing all the projects at demo day and asking a lot of questions to Cohort 17 programmers I feel a little more grounded in where I'm at with the journey. I think I'm going to be able to tone down the self-criticism of not knowing enough and start instead try to cultivate a spirit of gratitude for how much I know now in comparison to when we started and a more relaxed attitude about not being able to complete the exercises completely. Some of them I spend hours trying to get it right and it's basically to no avail. We didn't have any lab time this last week so it's understandable that my exercise count would go down. I really do well with a person like a TA there to help me on some critical points to keep me going. There's only so much I can do on my own. Nevertheless, I am definitely learning to rely on the internet and various online sources for help, and seeing that I can apply what I learn.",

		"title": "Week 6",
		"entry": "It's hard to imagine that six weeks have gone by. I'm not going to lie: there are some moments when I wish it were already over. I've said it from the beginning; this bootcamp is a test of my committment to change and become a better person. I've spent too many years of my life running away from place to place, wandering from city to city, looking for something perfect to deliver me from a miserable and tired state of confusion and discontent. In years past (and arguably up until now) I managed to construct a perfect identity of being forlorn and disconsolate. My hatred and judgement of the world was like a diamond it was so crystal clear; and yet I lived in a trough of inaction, afraid to change and essentially grow the hell up. I say all this because it is totally relevant for me to address as I write these blog posts. Every week goes by and I am thankful as I've ever been to have made it through without quitting and walking away. Sometimes my determination to succeed helps; other times it is oppressive as it has ever been and I can't give myself a break at all. I'm diseased with a quality that paradoxically allows me to live a healthier life than I ever have, yet the quality has the power to destroy my progress in a second. I have an insatiable ego. My beliefs about where I am at on this journey are very powerful. So I'm learning this week that I could kick back a bit and honor the simplicity of my continuous effort to show up each day and do my best to learn something new, which seems all that is essentially needed for me to move on and participate. Coding is not rocket science I'm learning; it's actually a very simple way of expressing and communicating. I looked at the board sometimes while the head instructor was leading us through some new coding examples and did have some momments where I could understand pretty quickly. Other times it was panic-mode right away. I'm greateful for the instructors for being there when I need them. I'm getting better at asking for help and to specify my questions. This week I worked solo on the slide-show exercise and it felt good to try to tackle it alone and go for help only after I had tried and failed a lot of times. I'm hangning on to the coutnerintuitive part of the learning process. I have a pretty good idea of how I would like to work during the week. I show up to class early, 7:30 and stay 'till 4 and then try to do an hour or two post class. Saturday I will also spend a little time with the code. I'm taking the day off on Sunday. This kind of time management actually is an important piece as I keep going. In other news I'm still learning more about cryptocurrencies and found out there is actually a podcast based in Nashville that is dedicated to all things bitcoin and blockchain, which I find really cool these days.",

		"title": "Week 5",
		"entry": "I started the week pretty distraught over the state of my coding skills. Par for the course so far. I spent what felt like way too many hours on the milestone challenge on Sunday leading into this week and I was definitely burned out for the first day of the week. To give myself a break, I think I did a pretty good job with the challenge this time around compared to the first challenge. This time I really took a crack out coding it out on my own as much as possible and only when I reached some intense levels of frustration did I seek help from the TAs. I will say though, that putting in the work by showing up early and asking questions in the morning helped along the way. I learned a couple new techniques for writing to the DOM using javascript or more like a deeper understanding of what was happening movement-wise. The group project called Chatty really did turn out to be a good experience. I dreaded going into it becuase of my frustration with the milestone challenge but as it turns out I got to play a role in some cool areas and we ended up coding together the majority of it on a projector. I looked at the code on Friday and could say what everyline was doing. I really enjoyed the team I was on and their personalities as well, which helped in a group setting. We were team '@$$hole' which sparked a whole bunch of jokes on Slack. I got some good feedback this week that I was doing fine in terms of exercises. It's weird; even when my instructors say, 'Hey Nick, no worries, you're doing awesome,' I still don't listen. I just go on beating myself up that I'm not doing enough. By the end of the week though I really had some peace of mind around where I was at, and I was happy to be moving on to another milestone. Thursday was a long day of learning new material. Friday, I got a couple last day exercises complete on this ongoing blog and the music player project. Trying to keep it simple. I have a tendency to complicate this process WWWAAYYYY too much. I'm even trying to maybe take a day to myself and perhaps not try to code and pound into my brain something new. Still I'm not so successful. If it's not something related to the material we are learning, I'm reading books about blockchain technology or Bitcoin. All in all it was a pretty typical up and down week, yet still going up and up on a pretty level trajectory.",
		"thingsLearned": "I see that I learned how to plan a little better this week. Actually sketch out pages, put boxes where inputs need to be, using diagrams etc, Greater understanding of looping through JSON files. The art of consolelogging. How to use a counter and give newly printed objects id's in an array. I learned how to close off a row in bootstrap when writing a long array of objects to the DOM. Seems a little late to the game but I actually wrote a function that had two parameters and I could see the way info was being passed along when it was called (pretty cool for me). Introduction to using Grunt. An introduction to the Jquery library. I was able to see how Jquery makes coding easier. Loading to different JSON files to the same page.",

		"title": "Week 4",
		"entry": "I'm glad that week four is done. We ventured into some deeper waters of Javascript and it really confused me at times. Looking at the Milestone Challenge and at some of the other exercises I have not completed all seems really daunting still. I definitely despaired at certain times this week questioning whether I could hang in there at all. I got some good feedback though that revealed I was actually doing somewhat better than average in terms of exercise completion so I didn't need to be so hard on myself. I need to learn to trust the process even more than I already have. I just sometimes can't believe that walking on a path to learn coding on a deeper level so I can really make a case against myself that I'm not worthy of this kind of work. Slowly but surely I'm dropping the attachments I have to this train of thought and entertaining more and more the ones that say I can do this. It helps to have the support of the instructors, also of fellow cohort members who on Friday really helped me to comprehend more concretely some Javascript fundamentals. I played a marginal role in the group project this week. I didn't plan for that to happen, it just simply happened that the heavy lifting on code was done overnight by the team lead and to be honest I didn't carry that much enthusiasm into it this time around. One thing I can change going forward is my attitude. Maybe I can start to have a little fun with this experience? Geezus...probably about time.",

		"title": "Week 3",
		"entry": "I'm having a hard time describing in words what week three was like so I'll suffice it to say that basically everything turned out pretty cool in the end and I came away from it with a deeper committment to learning how to read and write computer code. On Tuesday I had a cut and run moment and walked out of the building and said to myself, 'F this, I'm out of here', but ended up making a phone call to a friend who ended up a) validating that yes, I could get up and leave no problem and no one was going to stop me, and b) giving me some larger perspective about where I was in comparison to where I have been. I took some deep breaths and decided that staying was clearly the best thing to do and that humility was going to be key for me in seeking some help on how to understand core concepts. I had many moments this week where I really felt like I had to set aside an inflated ego and simply admit to my instructors that I was where I was at, which some exercises and challenges had revealed was way less competant than I had expected. I had so much pent up shame about it I actually cried on the way home Monday and Tuesday. Sad but true, and pretty much laughable in retrospect. I was left with a curiosity about myself I hadn't noticed, which was that I have carried some deep emotional baggage into this journey that I am consequently letting go of as I continue forward. So in a way, all the confusion of not knowing how to approach an exercise, or ask for help, or not even knowing what question to ask has been a perfect tool to use for establishing a platform to a true and higher learning. I also got a chance to present the project we made las week for which I was the team lead. Minus some technical difficulties and the fact that I was jittery to be standing in front of the class, the presentation went down okay. I found out I'm not a huge fan of being team lead.",

		"title": "Week 2",
		"entry": "The biggest takeaways from this week have been from working on group projects. The experience revealed a lot to me about how group dynamics can work on a software building project and it also effectively showed me how there are multiple factors that definitely go beyond the realm of simply coding which can determine the success of the project. I think the group project experiences this week tested my abilities to hang in there and get something done with fellow cohort members. I really appreciated the experience of being a team lead the second time. I enjoyed the process of working together and creating the color scheme and basic MVP design we were going for, and I think it set us off on the right track. We also did the javascript for our products page together and for me it felt like we were all on the same page as far as what it was doing with our array of products that we had created. In the end I liked how we all learned from one another for the good of the group and in the process became better coders and teammates for it.",

			"title": "Week One",
			"entry": "Without going too much into the details I think it would be a true to say that week one Nashville Software School went pretty well for me overall. The experience of being in an adult learning environment is teaching me a lot about my reactions and responses to life itself and in my own personal experience this type of awareness has allowed me to grow into a better person. I'm really glad that the staff and instructors stress to not compare myself to others along the path of completing the bootcamp. This has really helped me to relax and enjoy the time at school, and address what I need to focus on in the present moment each day. I completed the suggested pre-work leading up to the start. Previously, I had no coding experience, so all of the material was new to me. I think I did a pretty good job of hanging in there and completing the exercises, and came away from it with a decent understanding of how javascript works and feeling prepared to begin the class. HTML seemed much more straight forward to me. The people in the cohort all come from different backgrounds and it is refreshing to be around others who have a drive to learn and share what they are learning as well. I've enjoyed getting to know some of the people so far and hope to continue that. I completed some of the initial exercises for this module though not all of them. I made a bank form for a loan application, the beginning of a personal website, and this current blog, as well as made some style sheets for other exercises. I had some trouble with the product card exercise and ended up deleting a large chunk of html work, which in retrospect doesn't really seem appropriate to do. I should probably keep my html work no matter how frustrating the css ends up being. I learned about github and how to make branches and work on them locally and then push them up remotely and to create pull requests to merge my work on to the master branch, and then to pull the master down when I want to do more work. I'm really quite amazed that I picked up on that so far.",
